# Real-Time Posture Correction and Feedback Project 💪📹

A Python-based project that uses **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** for real-time posture detection and analysis during exercises. This project provides personalized exercise suggestions and audio feedback based on the user's posture to promote better workout form and effectiveness.

## Features 🚀
- **Real-Time Posture Detection**: Leverages MediaPipe for accurate body posture tracking.
- **Exercise Suggestions**: Offers personalized exercise recommendations based on analyzed posture.
- **Audio Feedback**: Provides live feedback to correct posture during workouts.
- **Efficient and Scalable**: Built using lightweight libraries for smooth performance.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Python**
- **MediaPipe**: For detecting and analyzing body landmarks.
- **OpenCV**: For video frame processing and real-time analysis.

## How It Works 📖
1. The project uses a webcam or video feed to detect and analyze the user's posture in real-time.
2. MediaPipe processes body landmarks, while OpenCV handles video frame capture and display.
3. Based on the posture analysis, the system generates:
   - Suggestions for improving posture.
   - Audio feedback to guide the user.
